Make sure you have already installed Minecraft Forge 1.8.9.
Download Essentials mod from this website.
Open your File Explorer, and type %appdata% in the search bar.
Click on .minecraft and their should be a folder called Mods.
Place the essential_1-3-2-5_forge_1-8-9.jar Mod into the Mods folder.
Open Minecraft and change the profile to 'forge'.
Once the game loads, you'll see the essentials mod active and working.
Everything from that point on is optional and self explanatory.
Have a awesome day (:
